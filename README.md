# Earthquake & Tsunami Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on earthquake data analysis and tsunami prediction. The project includes both **custom (from-scratch) implementations** and **library-based models**, along with exploratory data analysis and visualization tools.

## File Descriptions

### Notebooks

#### `classification_experiments.ipynb`
Contains experiments for the **classification task (tsunami prediction)**.  
Both library-based models and custom, from-scratch implementations are evaluated and compared using performance metrics and explainability techniques.

#### `data_analysis.ipynb`
Includes exploratory data analysis performed on the earthquake and tsunami datasets.  
The notebook covers:
- Feature distribution analysis  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Histograms and boxplots  
- Feature importance analysis  

These experiments were used to better understand the dataset before model development.

### Scripts

#### `dataset_explore.py`
Used exclusively to download the dataset from Kaggle.  
No preprocessing or modeling logic is included in this file.

#### `knn.py`
Contains a from-scratch implementation of the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm.  
This implementation is used for comparative analysis against library-based approaches.

#### `random_forest_scratch.py`
Implements a custom **Random Forest algorithm from scratch**, including:
- `Node` class  
- `DecisionTree` class  
- `RandomForest` class  

This file serves as the core of the custom ensemble learning approach used in both classification and regression tasks.

#### `regression_experiments.py`
Contains experiments for the **regression task**, specifically the estimation of the `sig` variable.  
Both custom implementations and library-based models are evaluated and compared.

### Data Files

#### `earthquake_1995-2023.csv`
The primary dataset used in the project.  
It represents a more complete version of the earthquake data, containing all records from the secondary dataset plus several hundred additional entries spanning the 1995–2023 period.

#### `earthquake_data_tsunami.csv`
A reduced version of the dataset, fully contained within `earthquake_1995-2023.csv`.  
Used in earlier experiments and for comparison purposes.

---

### Visualization

#### `map.py`
Uses the **Folium** library to generate an interactive map visualizing the geographic locations of tsunami-related events in the dataset.

#### `harta.html`
The HTML output generated by `map.py`.  
It contains an interactive map displaying tsunami locations.

---

### Other Files

#### `LICENSE`
Specifies the licensing terms of the project.

#### `README.md`
Provides an overview of the project structure, purpose, and file descriptions.

## Notes

- The project emphasizes **comparative analysis** between scratch implementations and library models.
- Explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP) are used to analyze model behavior.
- The repository is structured to support both **classification** (tsunami prediction) and **regression** (signal estimation) tasks.

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
